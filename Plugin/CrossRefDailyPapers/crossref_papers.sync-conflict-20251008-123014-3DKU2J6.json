    "abstract": "Kidney stones are solid mineral and salt deposits formed within the kidneys, causing excruciating discomfort and pain when they obstruct the urinary tract. The presence of speckle noise in CT-scan images, coupled with the limitations of manual interpretation, makes kidney stone detection challenging and highlighting the need for precise and efficient diagnosis. This research investigates the efficacy of YOLOv8 models for kidney stone detection, aiming to strike a balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy. This study's novel evaluation framework and practical deployment considerations underscore its contributions to advance kidney stone detection technologies. It evaluates five YOLOv8 variants (nano, small, medium, large, and extra-large) using standard metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and mAP@50, alongside computational resources like training time, power consumption, and memory usage. The comprehensive evaluation reveals that while YOLOv8s and YOLOv8e demonstrate superior performance in traditional metrics, YOLOv8s emerges as the optimal model, offering a harmonious balance with its high precision (0.917), highest mAP@50 (0.918), moderate power consumption (150W), and efficient memory usage. Graphical analyses further elucidate the behaviour of each model across different confidence thresholds, confirming the robustness of YOLOv8s. Additionally, this research explores the impact of model size and complexity on inference speed, demonstrating that smaller YOLOv8 variants achieve real-time performance with minimal latency. The study also introduces a method for model scalability, allowing for adjustments in accuracy and computational demand based on specific clinical or resource constraints. These contributions further emphasize the importance of holistic model assessment for real-world medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs). The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower frequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study aims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most massive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We selected successive galactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and re-simulated them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin down to binary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales were estimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave emission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we considered the impact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and anisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs. We find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an eccentricity of e&gt;0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA observed GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the eccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find that: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kiloparsecs, the dynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred million years; (ii) the binary formation time is not resolution-dependent; (iii) the scatter on the eccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; and (iv) triple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary that has not yet reached coalescence.",

    "abstract": "Highly sensitive high-speed biosensors are key devices for precise diagnostics, which allows the application of medical treatment in a short time. In this paper, noise spectra and characteristic time constants are studied in nanotransistors with channel sizes below 30[Formula: see text]nm. The quantization effect due to the formation of a quantum dot channel is analyzed based on the transport and noise properties of the device structures. Ultra-low flicker noise at the quantum level with a Hooge parameter of about 10[Formula: see text] is registered. A strong dependence of the characteristic switching time on the modulation effect is revealed with a slope ([Formula: see text]) that considerably exceeds the value of 1, which is typically obtained in large-area device structures. This reflects the fact that a 700% amplification of sensitivity in nanotransistor biosensors can be obtained. A dimensionless R-factor introduced by the ratio of the emission time constant to the capture time constant as a function of gate voltage reveals a slope equal to 20, which is promising for the extraction of very small signals from biomolecules with 20 times higher sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "With the swift growth of digital networks and information in both public and private sectors, it is essential to deal with the considerable threat that network attacks pose to data integrity and confidentiality. Consequently, there is a pressing requirement for the establishment of effective mechanisms to detect and provide recommendations for addressing intrusion attacks. In this paper, we propose a semantic-based intrusion detection system that aims to improve performance by incorporating semantic representations consisting of feature groups and their associated weights, leading to the creation of a weighted knowledge graph. The weights of the features are determined using sparse autoencoders. From these weights, the most significant features are normalized to a specific range. This approach comprises a combination of a Deep Auto Encoder (AE) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for intrusion detection. Furthermore, the ensemble method of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to identify and recommend high-probability attack scenarios. The dataset used to evaluate is the CSE-CIC-IDS dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, false positive rate, receiver operating characteristic metrics, loss, and error rate are used to measure the performance, and the results show the approach demonstrates substantial improvements in detection accuracy, minimizing false positives, enhancing reliability, and outperforming existing models. The combination of semantic knowledge, deep learning, and ensemble learning ensures a proactive and adaptive cybersecurity framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This paper presents a detailed analysis of the bit error rate (BER) performance of a proposed maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme for optical orthogonal time space modulation (OTSM) systems using 64-QPSK, considering practical optical impairments and diverse channel conditions. The evaluation covers scenarios with 5 % and 10 % channel estimation errors, as well as Rayleigh and Rician fading environments. Simulation results confirm that the proposed machine learning (ML) detector consistently outperforms conventional methods – including OTSM, zero-forcing equalization (ZFE), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and conventional ML – by delivering substantial SNR gains. For instance, under 10 % and 5 % estimation errors, the target BER of 10−3 is achieved at 12.2 dB and 10.8 dB, respectively, providing up to 6 dB improvement over baselines. In Rayleigh fading, the same BER is attained at 9.6 dB with a gain of 7.7 dB, while in Rician fading, the detector achieves optimal performance at only 6 dB, outperforming others by as much as 9.5 dB. These results underscore the robustness of the proposed ML approach against estimation inaccuracies and fading, making it well-suited for low-power, high-reliability applications in 6G, Internet of things (IoT), vehicular networks, and satellite communications.",

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity and dynamism of modern cyber threats necessitate intelligent and adaptive network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). This paper proposes a novel hybrid metaheuristic approach that combines the Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA) with the Virus Colony Search (VCS), enhanced by adaptive parameter tuning mechanisms. The proposed LOA-VCS hybrid algorithm addresses limitations in prior single and hybrid metaheuristic by alternating exploration and exploitation strategies across epochs, optimizing detection performance in high-dimensional feature spaces. Unlike previous hybrid metaheuristics that use fixed or non-adaptive control, our model uniquely alternates LOA and VCS phases adaptively across epochs to enhance convergence and detection robustness. A real-world intrusion detection dataset evaluated the LOA-VCS model with 98.4% detection accuracy, an F1-score of 0.976, and an AUC of 0.986, consistently outperforming the standalone LOA and VCS baselines. These results emphasize the power of adaptive hybrid met heuristics in maintaining low false alarms while ensuring strong recall for NIDS. The proposed approach can be deployed in scalable, high-speed systems in today’s contemporary cyber security environments.",
